# Hardware Lab Assignment 0

**This assignment focuses on implementing hardware components using Verilog HDL and acting as a prerequisite for the hardware lab**  
Design and implement the following logic functions using Verilog with behavioural modelling:
1. An 8-bit adder with sum and carry as output  

2. An 8-bit subtractor with a difference and borrow as output  

3. An 8-bit ALU that can perform addition, subtraction, bitwise XOR, and left shift
operation  

4. An 8-bit D latch with enable an active low reset
