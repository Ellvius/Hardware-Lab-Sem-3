# Hardware Lab Assignment 1

Design and implement the following using Verilog:
1. A finite-state machine to detect sequence 1101 in the input stream. If sequence is
detected output 1 else output 0  

2. Design a finite state machine (FSM) for a vending machine that dispense water which
costs Rs.15. The machine accepts coins of denominations 5 and 10 rupees only. The
machine should handle the following states: idle, accepting coin(s), returning change,
and dispensing water
